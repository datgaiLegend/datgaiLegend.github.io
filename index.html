		<h2 class="sub-header">Concepts</h2>
				<p>Heat, temperature, and thermal energy</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="key">Temperature is associated with the kinetic energy of particles, and often not a system as a whole, as it isn't uniform.</span> </li>
					<li>Because a higher temperature creates random molecular movement, we need to draw a distinction between the kinetic energy of the system as a whole and that of its individual particles. This is the difference between regular <span class="vocab">kinetic energy</span> and <span class="vocab">thermal energy</span>.<span class="important">Thermal energy is the energy of the random molecular movement in a system,</span> whereas kinetic energy refers to energy associated with any movement. </li>
					<li>Heat is different from thermal energy. Although colloquially we say "heat is gained" or "heat is lost", technically <span class="important">heat is simply the transfer of thermal energy</span>. The informal phrase means that the particles lose/gain kinetic energy from the surroundings.<br><img src="images/thermal-energy-heat.png" alt="thermal energy vs. heat vs. temperature" style="max-width:500px"></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Heat Capacity</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="important">The amount of energy required to raise the energy of a system by one degree (Celsius or Kelvin) is called the heat capacity of the system</span>.</li>
					<li> The <span class="vocab">heat capacity</span> of a system is <span class="formula">C = q/T</span>, where C is heat capacity, q is heat given, and T is temperature change. </li>
					<li> Specific heat capacity measures the amount of energy required to raise the energy of <span class="key">one gram</span> of the substance by one degree. Molar heat capacities refers to the amount of heat required to raise the temperature of <span class="key">one mole</span> of a substance by one degree.</li>
					<li> Heat capacities vary according to the state of the substance. Complexity and types of bonds are also factors in deciding the heat capacity of a substance.</li>
					<li> <span class="key">Lower molar mass means more atoms in one gram of a substance, which in turn means heat is spread over a larger number of entities, contributing to a higher specific heat capacity</span>. </li>
				</ul>

				<p>The first law of thermodynamics</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The first law of thermodynamics states that <span class="important">the total energy in the universe remains the same</span>.</li>
					<li> This means any heat gained by the system is lost from the surroundings and vice versa, which brings us to a conclusion that <span class="important">the heat gained/lost by the system is the negative of the heat change in the surroundings</span>.</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="\images\first-law.png" alt="first-law" style="max-width:550px">
				<p>Calorimetry</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In <span class="vocab">calorimetry</span>, scientists examine the amount of heat released/absorbed from a reaction. </li>
					<li>In a bomb calorimeter, the reactants are placed in a steel compartment where they react, changing the temperature of surrounding water. <span class="important">Measuring the temperature change and knowing the heat capacity of the calorimeter, you can identify how much heat was lost in the reaction</span>. </li>
					<li>In "coffee-cup" calorimetry (chemists on a budget), the reactants are mixed into an aqueous solution and temperature change is measured. Styrofoam is often used because it acts as a heat insulator, isolating the system. Again, heat capacity and the change in temperature are used to determine the energy released in the reaction. </li>
					<br> <div style="text-align:center"><img src="images/styrofoam-cup.jpg" alt="coffee-cup calorimeter" style="max-width:200px;display:inline-block"><img src="images/bomb-calorimeter.png" alt="bomb calorimeter" style="width:250px;display:inline-block"></div>
				</ul>

				<p>Work done by a reaction</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Sometimes the system or the surroundings could do work on each other. Often, this is through a change in volume or pressure, from the behaviour of a gas. This is known as <span class="vocab">pressure-volume work</span>. </li>
					<li>Its value is given by the equation: <span class="formula">Work = -External pressure on the gas x the change in volume</span>. The work is negative when energy leaves the system and positive when it enters the system. </li>
					<li>If you imagine a piston pulled down by the force of several weights compressing a gas, the gas does work on the piston if a weight is removed. This amount of work is equal to the distance the piston is lifted x the piston's mass x gravity's acceleration. Dividing the force of gravity by the piston's area and multiplying the height lifted by the area rearranges this statement to something more general: <span class="formula">negative external pressure x change in volume</span> . <br><img src="images/pressure-volume.png" alt="pressure-volume work" style="max-width:400px"></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Internal Energy</p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="important">Internal energy is the combination of molecular kinetic and potential energy in a system</span>. The kinetic energy includes the <span class="key">movements of the individual particles</span>, being translated, rotated, experiencing vibration or undergoing electrostatic interactions. Not heat or work, these are means of energy transfer. </li>
					<li> <span class="vocab">Internal Energy</span> is a <span class="vocab">function of state</span>, since it has a particular value depending on the state of the system, and <span class="important">it doesn't depend on the creation of the state of the system</span>. </li>
					<li>A positive change in internal energy is net energy entering the system, negative change in internal energy is net energy leaving the system.</li>
					 <li>Though it is possible to calculate the internal energy in an ideal gas, it is often very difficult to measure the internal energy of a system. However, the internal energy is always proportional to temperature of the system, so you can state that the internal energy of a system increases as temperature increases. </li>
					 <li>We can precisely measure the <span class="key">change</span> in internal energy. The change in internal energy is defined as the <span class="formula">heat released/gained plus any work done/experienced.</span></li>
				</ul>
				<img src="\images\internal-energy.png" alt="internal-energy" style="max-width:700px">

				<p>Enthalpy<p>
				<ul>
					<li><span class="important">Enthalpy is the combination of the energy within the system + energy from compression/expansion of gasses</span>. </li>
					Like internal energy, <span class="key">the enthalpy of a reaction cannot be precisely measured</span>. <span class="formula">The change in enthalpy is the heat released by a constant pressure reaction</span>, or the potential energy of products - the potential energy of reactants. This can also be rephrased as <span class="formula">the internal energy of a system + its pressure times its volume</span>. 
					<li>A reaction is therefore exothermic if it has negative change in enthalpy (releases energy), or endothermic if it has positive change in enthalpy (uses more energy than it releases). </li>
					<li>This is a <span class="key">function of state</span>; its value doesn't depend on the path taken to get to the state of the function. </li>
					<li>The <span class="vocab">enthalpy of reaction</span> is the <span class="formula">enthalpy change per mole of reaction</span> (a mole of reaction is the amount of substance needed for the balanced chemical reaction). The enthalpy of reaction can therefore be used to calculate the enthalpy of the same reaction in different quantities.</li>
				</ul>
				<img src="\images\enthalpy.png" alt="enthalpy" style="max-width:650px">

				<p>Standard Enthalpy of Reaction</p>
				<ul><li>The enthalpy change in a reaction where both the reactants and the products are in <span class="key">standard states</span>.	</li>
					<li> The standard state (defined) for a solid or liquid substance is the pure reactant at a <span class="key">pressure of 1 bar</span>. For a gas, this also includes it behaving as <span class="key">an ideal gas</span>. </li>
					<li>This enthalpy does not change depending on temperature. </li> <br><img src="images/reaction-enthalpy.jpg" alt="standard enthalpy of reaction" style="max-width:450px">
				</ul>
				
				<p>Hess' Law</p>
				<ul>
					<li>In a reaction that can be broken into different steps, <span class="formula">the enthalpy of the whole reaction is equal to the sum of the enthalpies of each step</span> (Hess' law), since enthalpy is a function of state.</li> 
					<li>This allows you to calculate enthalpies of reaction indirectly (or theoretically), when practically it's difficult to pull off an experiment. </li>
					<li>Since the standard enthalpy of reaction is <span class="key">the sum of molecules decomposing and forming</span>, it can be expressed as <span class="formula">the summation of the standard enthalpies of formation for products - the standard enthalpies of formation for products.</span></li>
				</ul>

				<p>Standard Enthalpy of Formation</p>
				<ul>
					<li>The <span class="vocab">standard enthalpy of formation</span> of a substance is <span class="important">the change in enthalpy when one mole of that substance in the standard state is created from the reference forms of the elements in their standard states</span>.</li> 
					<li>The reference form of an element is <span class="key">the most stable form of that element in the standard state</span>. For an element in its reference form, the standard enthalpy of formation is 0. </li>
					<li>Standard enthalpies of formation can be used to find standard enthalpies of reaction. In a reaction where a large molecule is broken into separate atoms and those atoms recombine, the <span class="key">standard enthalpies of formation can be used to determine the enthalpy change for each step in the reaction, and adding the enthalpy change of each step of the reaction yields the standard enthalpy of reaction</span> (Hess' Law). Thus, you can calculate theoretically the standard enthalpy of reaction from enthalpies of formation.</li>
				</ul>
				
				<p>Combustion of fuel</p>
				<ul>
					<li>Substances that yield exothermic reactions when combusted are known as <span class="vocab">fuels</span>. For their high energy release, many hydrocarbons formed after the slow decomposition of cellulose or organic matter, known as fossil fuels, are popular for creating heat or propulsive energy.</li>
					 <li>However, the oxides of nitrogen, sulfur, and carbon created in the combustion process prove detrimental to our current environment. The greenhouse effect, acid rain, and poor air quality are all consequences of this combustion.</li>

		<h2 class="sub-header">Formulae</h2>
			<img src="images/thermochem-formulae.png" alt="formulae" style="min-width:550px;float:none;display:block;margin:auto;" height="400"></td>
			<p>Formula #1: Change in internal energy = heat + work</p>
				<p class="tab">This is a result of the first law of thermodynamics. Since heat and work only occur when there is a transfer of energy between the system and its surroundings, by definition a change in internal energy is the combination of the heat and work created.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #2: Change in energy of the universe = change in energy of the system + change in energy of the surroundings</p>
				<p class="tab">Another interpretation of the first law. Since energy cannot be created nor destroyed, all energy is constant, meaning any energy change in the system is reciprocated in the surroundings, always totalling the energy of the universe.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #3: Heat capacity = heat absorbed/change in temperature</p>
				<p class="tab">A fundamental property of all material, which helps in calculating the change in enthalpy of the reaction.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #4: Heat absorbed/released by the system =  the negative heat absorbed/released by the surroundings</p>
				<p class="tab">A third interpretation of the first law. The sum of the change in heat of the surroundings and the system is always zero, and so rearranging we know that they are negatives of each other.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #5: Pressure-volume work = the negative of the external pressure x the change in volume</p>
				<p class="tab">Work done by a gas to counteract gravity is equal to mg x vertical distance travelled, and multiplying by area/area and rearranging we arrive at this more general equation, which outlines the magnitude of the work done by the compression or expansion of a gas in a reaction.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #6: Change in enthalpy = the heat absorbed/released by a constant pressure system</p>
				<p class="tab"> Since change in enthalpy = change in internal energy + pressure x the change in volume, if pressure is constant, the work and P x V cancel out, leaving only q, heat.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #7: Change in enthalpy = the change in internal energy + pressure x the change in volume</p>
				<p class="tab">This is the definition of enthalpy. Enthalpy is a function of state, which proves especially useful as it is equal to the heat released/absorbed of a constant pressure system.</p>
				<br>
			<p>Formula #8: The standard enthalpy of a reaction = the summation of the formation enthalpies of the products - the summation of the formation enthalpies of the reactants</p>
				<p class="tab">This is a rearrangement of Hess' law. Since you can add separate enthalpies of individual steps to arrive at the enthalpy of a reaction, this equation is valid.</p>

		<p>The following problems are taken from <span style="font-style:italic;">General Chemistry: Principles and Modern Applications</span> (Petrucci, Herring, Madura, & Bissonnette, 2017).</p>
